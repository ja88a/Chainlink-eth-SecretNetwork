# Secret Oracle Price Contract

WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a secret Oracle Price contract in Rust to run in
[Secret Network](https://github.com/enigmampc/SecretNetwork).
To understand the framework better, please read the overview in the
[cosmwasm repo](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/master/README.md),
and dig into the [cosmwasm docs](https://www.cosmwasm.com).
This assumes you understand the theory and just want to get coding.

Check out [Developing](./Developing.md) to explain
more on how to run tests and develop code. Or go through the
[online tutorial](https://www.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/intro) to get a better feel of how to develop.

[Publishing](./Publishing.md) contains useful information on how to publish your contract
to the world, once you are ready to deploy it on a running blockchain. And
[Importing](./Importing.md) contains information about pulling in other contracts or crates that have been published.
